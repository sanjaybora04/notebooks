I placed an order on the 31st August 2020 for a pair of trainers, which I paid with a gift voucher and applied a 25% promo at the time. 8th September I received an email to notify of delay in order due to stock. After speaking to several people, asking when it would be dispatched, they offered an extra 15% off as a gesture. (Acceptable at the time) however to this day it was still stuck \\'In progress\\' when they had already put stock back on their website. 1 agent said they would email the warehouse to process the order quickly. Another agent told me they couldn\\'t email the warehouse? I was also told that delayed orders are prioritised over new orders, but then another agent stated from their experience, cancelling the order and reordering again would be quicker!? I asked if a manager could call me to discuss the issue, as I cannot believe in 2020 no one can simply put a call/email into the warehouse to speed up a delivery which has been delayed significantly. Never received a call after being promised someone would call me on either the Saturday or Monday just gone. No emails received either. I then decided to call today to simply cancel the order and reorder, to my annoyance that I was told that they cannot honour the 25% promo code again but would have to reimburse, once Ive paid full price!? The worst part of this experience which topped it for me, I spoke to Ryan today, who in all my years of interaction with a customer service rep, have I spoke to someone who is so rude and confrontational. I was gobsmacked by his tone of voice, which was aggressive and he assumed upon previous notes, (He was very quick to tell me notes his colleague left). I am still shocked by the way he spoke to me. He is based in Dublin/Ireland where most of their customer service is. I have now cancelled and left short of order. - Goes well if stocks in place but if something delays, be prepared for a nightmare. If you want Nike products i would go via 3rd Parties and not direct because their clearly is no consequence for staff who act inappropriately.\",1,Bad,2020-09-24,4,United Kingdom\\r\\nAydin,waiting to long for delivery,,4, Great,2020-09-24,4,Kuwait\\r\\nDanielle McC,My daughter loves her sports clothing\\xe2\\x80\\xa6,\"My daughter loves her sports clothing and Nike are always on her list of wants.

How can I return a product I never received nor did I order to know what it was to even return. You know who ordered the product why not charge them? go after them? since they technically didn\\'t pay for YOUR products and just return the money that is mine that your customer used to fraudulently pay for your products.

This is someone who went out of their way to help a customer and shows they value the company they work for.\",5, Excellent,2020-05-28,7,United States\\r\\nNatasha,A Shambles in Every Way,\"Prior to this experience, I believed Nike to be a reputable and trustworthy brand. The level of disorganisation in their internal processes is unlike anything I have ever experienced before while shopping online. Their staff clearly don\\'t care, and are not properly trained.- Non-existent care for customers. Staff purposefully end calls and online chat when they can\\'t be bothered dealing with your query, forget to send appropriate paperwork, and accuse you of ignoring them when they fail to check their inboxes.- Inaccurate stock displayed online, resulting in cancelled orders without explanation or apology.- Online chat queues of routinely over 300 people, and a phone number that never connects.- Apparently zero complaints procedures or dispute resolution. Pure incompetence.- Clearly no interest in keeping customers. After receiving a pair of shoes ordered online at Nike.com, I reached out to Customer Care to request an exchange to the half-size down. A simple request, which led to waiting in a virtual queue of over 300 people, on five different occasions! A complete lack of organisation and competency meant that firstly, I was not sent the requested exchange return label, to then being sent the wrong return label, to my order then being cancelled due to \"\"no longer being available\"\", whilst still being\\' available to purchase\\' on their website. This will become a theme here.At this point, I had to rejoin the 300+ queue to make a complaint, and was offered an additional discount on top of the offer I had original used to purchased my shoes, as a form of apology. So after being reassured that there would be no further complications or hassles surrounding my purchase, I agreed to purchase the shoes once again. One week later, feeling wrongly confident that things were finally sorted, I receive that familiar \"\"cancelled due to no longer being available\"\" email, whist, you\\'ve guessed it, still being available to purchase online. This was the straw that broke the camels back and I was determined to make a formal complaint, I had wasted an inordinate amount of time. Over the course of an entire month of back and forth with Nike Customer Support, with no solution. Finally, number one in the queue again, I have never made a formal complaint before, but now is the moment. Lyle, greets me and says that he will handle my complaint, only to be informed that the previous member of Nike was wrong for offering a discount as compensation and I should instead order a different pair of shoes in the next online sale. Furthermore, it transpires that the repeated cancelled orders are due to their website not accurately displaying what it available to ship at the warehouse, this seems counterproductive for all involved, no? But the cherry on top, the piece de resistance: as this waste of time had now gone past 5pm (presumably), Lyle unilaterally terminates our chat mid-message. No apology and no conclusion, and frankly no care given.In the past I have owned plenty of great shoes from Nike, but I do not recommend ordering from Nike online. If you receive your shoes and they fit fine then that\\'s great, but just know that should you run into any issues Nike are not remotely interested in whether or not you receive your order or have a positive shopping experience. Instead, I have bought from Asics, who I do recommend. Simple and hassle free.

None of which were small orders. EVERY order atleast 2 items sent back due to the quality of the material (bobbling when washed within 2 weeks) or just the items were constructed badly. Also ordered trainers, and returned them before i even got them, as UPS doesnt know how to ring when unsure of location, and i wasnt in the mood to sit in all day again because UPS dont do delivery estimated times. Nike your ONLY saving grace is the customer services. Very friendly and helpful. Oh and i needed to exchange one item due to shoddly put together by one of nikes obscure location factorys (no arm hole elastic, arms too long and main body cut dodgy), sent the thing back YOU had it a week and ended up having to call customer services who couldnt understand why it hadnt been sent.
